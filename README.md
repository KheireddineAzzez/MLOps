- The first step is to install Docker on your pc because we are gonna to use docker to push our Docker image on google cloud registry. [Docker Instalation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- The next step is one of the most important step in this  tutorial where we are going to create a [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/) Account.
  After creation you  GCP Account, we have to do some steps:
  - First of all we have to create a project, go now and click on that box ![](https://drive.google.com/u/0/uc?id=1xilD072rqAb-onjDaDe37J86VT3iPpJI&export=view)

#### Activate services 

* In this step we are going to activate some service which are :
   - Google Cloud Registry (GCR)
   - Google cloud Storage
   - AI Platform 
   -
